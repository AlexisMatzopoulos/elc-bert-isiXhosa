# Finetuning 

To reproduce our results, follow the following steps:

Run the format_model.py file. This file takes the training checkpoint file, the output file name and the finetuning task required as inputs, and extracts the model weights in a format that is compatible with Hugging Face, and add all other required files (namely special_tokens_map.json, config.json and tokenizer.json files)

```bash
python formatmodel.py \
    --input_path models/my_model.pth \
    --output_folder output_models \
    --finetuning_task ner
```

Once you have done this, navigate to the subfolder of the task you would like to finetune the model on (ner, pos or news)
In bash script (ner.sh, pos.sh or news.sh respectively), set the MODEL_PATH variable to the path of your output folder that was generated by running `formatmodel.py`

Running these bash scripts will finetune the model on the task, and output the results to the results folder.

If your paths or data differ, simply update these parameters in the arguments of the formatmodel.py file and add your data in the finetune_data folder.
